            <p>A beautiful example of Rajasthani architecture, Vyas Chhatri as the name suggests, is dedicated to sage Vyaas, the writer of the epic Mahabharata. This local version of a cenotaph, is made up of delicate carvings that are a sight to behold. This is also one of the most scenic spots to catch a sunset in the desert.</p>

            <p>Equidistant from Jaisalmer and Lodhruva, Bada Bagh, literally meaning big garden, features a series of royal cenotaphs or chhatris of Jaisalmer Maharajas, including that of Jai Singh II (Maharaja Sawai Jai Sing). The first cenotaph in the region was built for Jai Singh II by his son, Lunkaran, in the 16th century. Jai Singh II was known for his contribution to making the city green. And to honor him, his son set up a memorial in the form of cenotaph near the dam and created a big park around it. All the cenotaphs here have a beautifully carved ceiling and elegant equestrian statues of rulers. The location of the garden is such that it offers incredible sunset vistas to tourists.</p>

            <p>Tazia Tower of Jaisalmer is one of the major tourist attractions. If you have done with the various Rajputana architectures scattered in the city, Tazia tower will come as a welcome break to you. It is situated in the excellent 'Badal Palace' complex located near Amar Sagar Gate. These were the homes of the former royal family. The Tazia tower is a 5-storied structure where each story has significance in its own. On each floor there is a balcony that is famous for their individual designs. This was built by Muslim craftsmen and is based on the shape of Tazia. Tazia is actually the replica of Mausoleum of various Imams. They are made of wood, thermocol and colored papers. The architects gifted it to the then royal patrons.</p>

            <p>The Golden City of Jaisalmer in Rajasthan is simply unmatched. It was the part of the famous Silk Route during the days of yore. The splendid Jaisalmer Fort stands proudly on its land and narrates the stories of the valor and chivalry of the Rajput rulers. Jaisalmer still retains its medieval charm, which is evident in its colorful narrow streets, splendid forts and palaces of Rajasthan, opulent havelis and bazaars.

The otherwise barren land of Jaisalmer comes alive once every year during winters. It is the time when the festivities of Desert Festival slowly start engulfing the Desert City. During the festival in Jaisalmer, the city displays the wealth of its culture and traditions to the rest of the world. The festival expresses the people's zeal for the life and is a colorful extravaganza of fun, frolic, laughter and adventure.</p>
